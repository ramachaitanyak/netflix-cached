# This Document outlines the identified remainder of work with some nice to haves

1. Handle logging infrastructure to record events and help debugging
2. Introduce signal handling infrastructure to gracefully handle SIGINT, SIGPIPE etc.
   * SIGPIPE or Broken Pipe error is generated when the server writes on a socket that has been
     closed. This can happend when the client sends a request and closes the client socket
     without waiting for reply from the server
3. Handle graceful shutdown where the server can be shutdown by draining any requests and flushing
   in-memory meta-data to disk.
4. Implement an infrastructure to re-cycle and clean stale client sockets. This will reduce the
   memory foot-print on the server
